# Retainsure URL Shortener

Retainsure is a full-stack URL shortening service with React frontend and Node.js backend. It lets users shorten long URLs, share short links, and view analytics on link usage.

---

## Project Structure

- `/url-shortner/backend` — Node.js + Express backend API  
- `/url-shortner/frontend/url-shortner-frontend` — React frontend app

---

## Features

- Shorten long URLs to short codes
- Redirect short URLs to original targets
- Track click analytics (click count, created date)
- Frontend interface for URL shortening and analytics retrieval
- REST APIs supporting JSON data exchange

---

## Backend Setup

1. Navigate to backend directory:

   ```
   cd url-shortner/backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the backend server locally:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. Backend runs on default port (e.g., 5000). You can test via:

   - `POST /api/shorten` to shorten URL
   - `GET /api/stats/:code` to fetch stats for short code

---

## Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to frontend directory:

   ```
   cd url-shortner/frontend/url-shortner-frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Run frontend locally:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. The React app runs on default port (e.g., 3000). It communicates with backend REST API.
